# hugging-quik
A helper package to make loading/unloading huggingface models quik-er

This was originally part of [pytorch-quik](https://github.com/donchesworth/pytorch-quik), but its requirements are large, and hugging-quik is a simple way to pull and use huggingface.co pretrained models and tokenizers.
